**
**  Purpose:
**    Define the 42 Library interface
**
**  Notes:
**   1. This is part of prototype effort to port a 42 simulator FSW controller
**      component into a cFS-based application. The source files in this 
**      library have been copied from 42. For convenience they are contained
**      in a single directory although they come from the following 42 
**      source directories:
**         42/Include
**         42/Kit/
**         42/Source
**
**   2. This library is used by the BC42_INTF and BC42_CTRL apps. Effort has
**      been made to minimize changes to the 42 source files. All changes are
**      marked with a "~bc~" tag in a comment. 
**   3. For more 42 information please see
**         42/Docs/
**         42/Database/Readme.txt
**         42/Standalone/Readme.txt
